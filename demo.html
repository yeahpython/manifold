    This is the starter page for a new project on multivariable calculus education.
    <ul>
      <li>Multivariable calculus is useful for students of many disciplines</li>
      <li>It's hard to learn</li>
      <li>It's generally explained in 3D</li>
      <li>For years, it's been taught on 2D whiteboards, which makes some concepts difficult to convey</li>
      <li>It's finally possible to teach this stuff in interactive 3D!</li>
    </ul>
