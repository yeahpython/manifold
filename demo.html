      This is the starter page of a new tool for multivariable calculus education. Here's the basic premise:
      <ul>
        <li>Multivariable calculus is useful for students of many disciplines</li>
        <li>It's hard to learn</li>
        <li>It's generally explained in 3D</li>
        <li>For years, it's been taught on 2D whiteboards, which makes some concepts difficult to convey</li>
        <li>It's finally possible to teach this stuff in interactive 3D, so let's do it!</li>
      </ul>
